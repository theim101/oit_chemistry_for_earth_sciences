## 🧭 Instructor Notes

- Keep lectures conceptual and visual.  
- Use simple examples linking to natural processes (e.g., rainwater pH).  
- Emphasize “why” behind equilibria, not just calculations.  
- Use visuals: diagrams, flowcharts, and sketches.  
- Tutorials should consolidate intuition before quantitative rigor.
