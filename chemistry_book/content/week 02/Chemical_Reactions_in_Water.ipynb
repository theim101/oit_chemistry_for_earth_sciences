Please note that this chapter explains the concepts using gases. As gases do not contain a charge, activities and concentrations are assumed to be identical. If we assume that the reactions take place in a vessel with fixed volume ($V$), pressure ($P$) and temperature ($T$ we can use the ideal gas law to relate pressure to the number of molecules present in the vessel ($n$). Please note that molar concentration of a compound i is the number of moles this compound i normalized to volume: $m_i = n_i/V$. Using the gas law:\n",

    "There are a number of approaches to estimate the activity of a chemical species in solution. Two well known equations are the Debeye-Hückel and the Davies equations. The Davies equation is an extension of the Debye–Hückel equation. The Debye–Hückel (extended) equation is accurate for I < 0.1 mol/kg, the Davies equation works reasonably well for 0 < I ≤ 0.5 mol/kg. For I > 0.5 mol/kg, you need more advanced models like Pitzer equations or Specific Ion Interaction Theory (SIT), which we will not discuss in this course. The Davies equation is given as:\n",
