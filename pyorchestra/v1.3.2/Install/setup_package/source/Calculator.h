	/**
	 * All calculations in Orchestra are performed by Orchestra Calculator objects.
	 * A Calculator is "programmed" by its own input file, in terms of Variables,
	 * Expressions and UnEq's (Unknown-Equation combination). 
	 * A standard Calculator operates on 1 node (e.g chemical equilibrium calculators, update mass). 
	 * A transport Calculator operates on 2 nodes (Convection, diffusion calculators) and has acces to the variables 
	 * in both nodes. 
	 * Data communication between calculators and nodes is performed by the IOObjects, which
	 * are programmed during the linking stage.
	 * Linking takes place when the calculator perform method is used  for the first time on a node.
	 *
